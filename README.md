## What is this?

A light theme for [Typora](https://typora.io) built around the XKCD font.

## What is Typora?

Typora is a minimal, free markdown editor which additionally supports Latex using MathJax. It's my go-to app when I'm writing blog posts or writeups.

## Installation 

- Download the [xkcd-theme]() zip
- In Typora, open Theme Folder from Preference Panel â†’ Appearance section.
- Copy `xkcd.css` and the `xkcd` directory, into the newly opened folder.
- Restart typora, then select `xkcd` from Themes menu.

## Issues

This was developed on a mac, and I haven't installed it elsewhere to check it, so if something looks wrong your end, please open an issue.
