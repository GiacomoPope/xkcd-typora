## What is this?

A light theme for [Typora](https://typora.io) built around the [xkcd font](https://github.com/ipython/xkcd-font).

## What is Typora?

Typora is a minimal, free markdown editor which additionally supports Latex using MathJax. It's my go-to app when I'm writing blog posts or writeups.

## Installation 

- Download the [xkcd-theme](https://github.com/jack4818/xkcd-typora/blob/98b357bf5083a8cf2f941823541986b6f917a0de/xkcd-theme.zip) zip
- In Typora, open Theme Folder from Preference Panel â†’ Appearance section.
- Copy `xkcd.css` and the `xkcd` directory, into the newly opened folder.
- Restart typora, then select `xkcd` from Themes menu.

## Issues

This was developed on a mac, and I haven't installed it elsewhere to check it, so if something looks wrong your end, please open an issue.

## Typography

The font is called `xkcd-script` and has been downloaded from [xkcd-font](https://github.com/ipython/xkcd-font). 
A monospaced version of the font called `xkcd-script-mono` was generated using [monospacifier](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/monospacifier).
