## What is this?

A light theme for [Typora](https://typora.io) built around the [xkcd font](https://github.com/ipython/xkcd-font).

## What is Typora?

Typora is a minimal, free markdown editor which additionally supports Latex using MathJax. It's my go-to app when I'm writing blog posts or writeups.

## Installation 

- Download the [xkcd-theme](https://github.com/jack4818/xkcd-typora/blob/019d13a24247d6db5f8748bb0071868d7dfabaae/xkcd-theme.zip) zip
- In Typora, open Theme Folder from Preference Panel â†’ Appearance section.
- Copy `xkcd.css` and the `xkcd` directory, into the newly opened folder.
